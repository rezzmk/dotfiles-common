# dotfiles-common (Any platform)

This repository contains the configuration files for most of the software I use.
It's still being "filled up" and the idea is to be able to have a hub with all my dotfiles, which will in turn be consumed by automatic scripts on dotfiles-windows/linux.

### Usage:
```
mkdir ~/.repos
mkdir ~/.repos/rezzmk
git clone https://github.com/rezzmk/dotfiles-common.git ~/.repos/rezzmk/dotfiles-common
```

### Current configs:
- VSCode (with extensions)
- Ideavim (vimrc used by the Ideavim plugin, on jetbrains IDEs)
